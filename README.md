# CloudWalk Agents Swarm Challenge (by Davi Carneiro)

A multi-agent system built as a coding challenge for CloudWalk in Python.  
This application orchestrates several specialized AI agents to handle routing, knowledge retrieval, customer support, and scheduling tasks, all exposed via a FastAPI HTTP interface and Dockerized for easy deployment.

---

## Frameworks & Libraries

- **FastAPI** – HTTP server and routing  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerization  
- **LangChain / LangGraph** – Agents orchestration 
- **Supabase** – User data, support calls, and appointment scheduling storage
- **Weaviate** – Vector database for RAG queries and document storage  
- **OpenAI API** – LLM back end & Moderation (Guardrails)  
- Others: see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

---

## Project Overview

This repository implements an **Agent Swarm**—a coordinated set of AI agents that collaborate to process incoming user messages and fulfill a variety of tasks:

1. **Supervisor (Router) Agent**  
   - Entry point for all messages; routes requests to the appropriate agent or finish the agents work
   - Calls "personality_node" in order to generate a final response

2. **Knowledge Agent**  
   - Handles RAG-based retrieval over InfinitePay’s website content ingested to Weaviate vector store  
   - Web search tool for external information retrieval

3. **Customer Support Agent**  
   - Provides user-centric support using Supabase as database
   - Includes tools for retrieving user information and registering support calls for human team assesment

4. **Secretary Agent**  
   - Manages appointment scheduling with human intervention hooks
   - Online meetings are booked for identity checking purposes when fund transfers are blocked for the user  
   - Integrates a simple calendar toolset able to check availability and add new appointments

## Graph Flow and Architecture

```python
        ...
        # Main Graph Nodes
        graph.add_node("supervisor", supervisor_agent)
        graph.add_node("knowledge_agent", knowledge_agent)
        graph.add_node("customer_service_agent", customer_service_agent)
        graph.add_node("secretary_agent", secretary_agent)
        graph.add_node("summarization_node", summarization_node)
        graph.add_node("personality_node", personality_node)

        # Main Graph Edges
        graph.add_edge(START, "summarization_node")
        graph.add_edge("summarization_node", "supervisor")
        graph.add_edge("knowledge_agent", "supervisor")
        graph.add_edge("customer_service_agent", "supervisor")
        graph.add_edge("secretary_agent", "supervisor")
        graph.add_edge("personality_node", END)  
        ...  
```
1st node -`Summarization node` (`graphs/other_components/summarization_node.py`) 
- Used to generate summaries of the conversation, preventting the messages list of the chat history from growing too large. 
- The necessity for summarization is checked at runtime, always before calling the supervisor agent to analyze the user's input

2nd node - `Supervisor` (`graphs/general_agent_subgraph.py`) 
- Agents communicate via direct tool calls always within a central workflow graph (`graphs/main_graph.py`).  
- Must await the response of the last transfered agent before transferring control to another agent or calling the personality node.

Agent Nodes - `Agents` (`graphs/general_agent_subgraph.py`) 
- Each agent subgraph is generated in the `graphs/general_agent_subgraph.py` file and composes the main graph as nodes.
- Mandatory to send back a response to the supervisor agent.

Last node - `Personality node` (`graphs/other_components/personality_node.py`) 
- Is used to generate a final response to the user, gathering all data from the conversation history.
- Generates a final response adding personality to the response.

---

## Configuration

- Edit environment variables in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
- The most sensitive variables are related to external services and are displayed bellow:

```yaml
    environment:
      # --- Supabase ---
      SUPABASE_URL: "https://qmcdadefjwjxjylslljt.supabase.co"
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InFtY2RhZGVmandqeGp5bHNsbGp0Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNTM3NDU0NywiZXhwIjoyMDQwOTUwNTQ3fQ.uSeiiInAsSlzjQiZuwOgdqaZDshMSaSkzFGHPezzDN4"

       # --- Web_Search_Tool ---
      TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY: "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"

      # --- LLM / OpenAI ---
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "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"
```

- The other variables are majorly related to the application's runtime configurations, such as business rules, LLM parameters, etc
---

## Building & Running

`IT IS READY TO RUN! PERMISSION GRANTED FOR USING MY OWN TOKENS AND OTHER PRIVATE KEYS IF WANTED`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## API Endpoints and Execution Steps

### STEP 1: **Ingest URL Data**  
   `POST /routes/ingest_data`  
   - Ingests data from a given set of URLs, must be done before invoking the swarm
   - Request body:
```json
{
    "urls": ["url1", "url2","url3", "..."]
}
```
   - Windows PowerShell command for data ingestion:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:10000/ingest_url_content" `
-Method Post `
-ContentType "application/json" `
-Body '{
  "urls": [
    "https://www.infinitePay.io",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/maquininha",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/maquininha-celular",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/tap-to-pay",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/pdv",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/receba-na-hora",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/gestao-de-cobranca-2",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/gestao-de-cobranca",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/link-de-pagamento",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/loja-online",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/boleto",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/conta-digital",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/conta-pj",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/pix",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/pix-parcelado",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/emprestimo",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/cartao",
    "https://www.infinitePay.io/rendimento"
  ]
}'

```

### STEP 2: **Invoke Swarm**  
   `POST /routes/invoke`  
   - Request body for regular message flow:
```json
{
    "message": "Your message here",
    "user_id": "client789"
}
```
   - Windows PowerShell command to invoke the swarm:
```powershell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10000/invoke `
-H "Content-Type: application/json" `
-d "{\"message\": \"Your message here\", \"user_id\": \"client789\"}"
```

---

## RAG Pipeline Description

1. URL data ingestion in the vector db through the ingest_data route, described in STEP 1 of the previous section, shown bellow:
```python
...
@router.post("/ingest_url_content", response_model=IngestResponse)
def ingest(req: IngestRequest) -> IngestResponse:
    logger.info(f"Received ingestion request with {len(req.urls)} URLs")

    # Urls validation
    if not req.urls:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Please, send at least one URL...")

    # Ingestion
    raw_results = ingest_urls_to_weaviate(
        urls=[str(u) for u in req.urls],
        index_name=INDEX_NAME,
        openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
        embeddings_model=EMBEDDINGS_MODEL,
    )

    # Results
    results = [IngestResult(**r) for r in raw_results]
    total_chunks = sum(r.chunks for r in results if r.ok)

    return IngestResponse(collection=INDEX_NAME, results=results, total_chunks=total_chunks)
```

2. Loop execution for data fetching and processing, each url at a time, always using Langchain components, implemented in `utils/ingest_data_utils.py`:
    - *WebBaseLoader* is used to fetch the data from the url
    - *RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter* is used to split the data into chunks
    - *OpenAIEmbeddings* is used to generate embeddings for the data
    - *WeaviateVectorStore* interface is used to store the data in the vector db

```python
...
        for url in urls:
            # Fetch HTML
            logger.debug(f"Processing URL: {url}")
            status, html, meta = fetch_html(url)
...
            # Load documents
            try:
                docs = WebBaseLoader(url).load()
                logger.info(f"Loaded {len(docs)} documents from {url}")
...
            # Split documents and add metadata
            for d in docs:
                d.metadata = {**(d.metadata or {}), "source": url}
            splits = splitter.split_documents(docs)
...
            # Add docments to vectorstore
            texts = [doc.page_content for doc in splits]
            metadatas = [doc.metadata for doc in splits]
            vectorstore.add_texts(texts=texts, metadatas=metadatas)
```

3. Retrieval querys are performed using the WeaviateVectorStore interface as retriever tool in, implemented in `tools/knowledge_agent/retriever_tool.py`:
```python
...
def initialize_retriever_for_rag():

    # Defines the embeddings model
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=EMBEDDINGS_MODEL)
    weaviate_client = create_weaviate_client()

    # Initializes the WeaviateVectorStore
    db = WeaviateVectorStore(
        embedding=embeddings,
        client=weaviate_client,
        index_name=INDEX_NAME,
        text_key="content",
        use_multi_tenancy=False
    )

    # Returns the configured retriever based on the interface with the vector store
    retriever = db.as_retriever(
        search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
        search_kwargs={
            "score_threshold": float(RETRIEVER_SCORE_THRESHOLD),
            "k": int(RETRIEVER_K),
            "alpha": float(RETRIEVER_ALPHA),
        }
    )

    # Returns the configured retriever tool ready for use by the agent
    retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
        retriever, 
        name="retriever_tool",
        description="Use this tool to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base based on the user's query"
    )
    return retriever_tool
```

## Bonus Features

- **Fourth Agent**
    - The secretary agent has been additionaly implemented with the objective of checking availability for booking new appointments and create new appointments registers in the table 'appointments' in the database.
    - Every time the user has fund transfers blocked, the only way to unlock them is to book an appointment with a costumer success specialist, wich is arrenged by the secretary agent.

- **Guardrails** for input/output parsing  
    - Guardrails are implemented in `utils/moderation.py` and invoked before/after LLM calls inside `routes/invoke_route.py`.
    - The OpenAI Moderation API assess the content of the messages to ensure they do not contain inappropriate content,
        analyzing both the input and output messages, evaluating them against a set of categories, including: hate speech, sexual content, violence, harassment, etc.

```python
        ...
        # =========================
        # Input guardrail (pretty much the same for output)
        # =========================
        try:
            mod_result = assert_safe_input_or_raise(message, user_id="system")
            logger.info(
                "Moderation approved | flagged=%s | categories_true=%s",
                mod_result.flagged,
                _cats_true(mod_result),
            )
        except ModerationError as me:
            logger.warning("Input blocked by moderation: %s", me)
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(me))
```

---

- **Human Intervention** 
    - Every single call to the secretary agent's add_appointment tool requires human intervention. 
    - It iss necessary to approve the appointment before it is created.
    - If not approved, the user will be instructed to await for human contact.
    - Inside the add_appointment tool, there is a call to the interrupt function.

```python
    response = interrupt(  
        f"Trying to call `add_appointment` with args {{'user_id': {user_id}, 'start_time': {start_time}, 'end_time': {end_time}}}. "
        "Do you approve this appointment? \n"
        "Please answer with 'YES' or 'NO'."
    )
```

- In ther request schema in the `routes/invoke_route.py` file, there is a field called "human_intervention_response" which flags if the current request is a response to address a human intervention interruption or a regular message coming from the user.
```python
        # Request schema
        class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
            message: str
            user: str
            human_intervention_response: Optional[bool] = False

```

- Inside the `main_graph.py` file, in the very end of the code, there are two different invoking patterns:
```python
        ...
            if not human_intervention_response:
            # Regular message flow
            output = compiled_graph.invoke({"messages": [input_message]}, config)
        ...
            else:
            # Human intervention response
            output = compiled_graph.invoke(Command(resume={"type": f"{user_message}"}), config)
        ...
```

- Request body for human intervention response:
```json
     {
       "message": "requested response by human intervention goes here",
       "user_id": "client789",
       "human_intervention_response": true
     }
```
